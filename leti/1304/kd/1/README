1. Create directory 
mkdir directory
2. Go to this directory 
cd directory
3. Run cmake tool
cmake path-to-lek/1
4. Start building
make

These steps will create tbb_images file
Command line options:
-l [value] - limit of images in graph
-b [value] -brightness value to find
-f [filepath] -file for logging average brightness
-n [value] -number of generated images
-minW [value] -minimum width of generated images
-minH [value] -minimum height of generated images
-maxW [value] -maximum width of generated images
-maxH [value] -maximum height of generated images
-d [on/off] - for turning debug mode.

In debug mode:
1. Generated images are in files "Image[image_id].log"
2. Highligted and inverse images in files "ResultImage[image_id].log"
